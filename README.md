# Running JavaScript Code in Node REPL

## Objectives

1. Use REPL
1. Execute code in REPL
1. Exit REPL

## Introduction

Understanding of Node REPL will give you a tool to test your Node code quickly. A good example will be writing a `sum` function and a date function.

## Instructions

* Enter REPL
* Write Node code to perform math by creating a sum function
* Write and call the `sum` function which adds two numbers together and returns the solution. The numbers are arguments to the function. 
* Find out what the day of the week was the day of the Declaration of Independence (July 4th, 1776) by creating a data object for the date. For example, `new Date(2015, 11, 31)` for Dec 31, 2015.
* Exit REPL
