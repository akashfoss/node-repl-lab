# Running JavaScript Code in Node REPL

## Objectives

1. Use REPL
1. Execute code in REPL
1. Exit REPL

## Introduction

A good understanding of Node REPL will give you a tool to test your Node code quickly. We'll practicing using the REPLY by writing a `sum` function and a `Date` constructor function.

## Instructions

* Enter REPL
* Write Node code to perform math by creating a sum function which adds two numbers together and returns the solution. The numbers should be passed as parameters to the function. 
* Write and call the `sum` function
* Find out what the day of the week was the day of the Declaration of Independence (July 4th, 1776) by creating a date object for the date. For example, `new Date(2015, 11, 31)` for Dec 31, 2015.
* Exit REPL
